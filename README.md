## About
This is a hobby project that serves as an alternative to the PlayQuest.Online
website. It serves the same purpose as an unofficial aid to the Quest RPG System
It provides the same realtime functionality where players and GMs can handle their adventures in real time.
The goal of this specific project though was to provide enhanced UI/UX as well as provide an open source alternative.
All of the code is hosted on github so updates, changes, and improvements can be made by anyone wanting to make the site better.
